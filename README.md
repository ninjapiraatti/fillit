# Hive Helsinki: Fillit
C, First attempts at recursion and something resembling an algorithm

Co-author: @melissaalasalmi

## How to run it
Clone, make and then run:

`./fillit [mapfile]`

## Challenge
Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.

## Solution
We basically brute forced it. Recursive function tests every solution.

## In hindsight
Oh dear god, I don't have to revisit the code, do I?
